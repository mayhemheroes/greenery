# greenery/mayhem/build.sh — build the ELF launcher shims for the Atheris fuzz harness and the
# test runner. greenery (qntm/greenery) is a PURE-PYTHON package with no runtime dependencies and
# no native code to compile or sanitize. The Atheris harness (mayhem/fuzz_parse_operations.py) is a
# `.py`, but Mayhem requires the target `cmd:` to be an ELF, so we compile a tiny C shim per Python
# entry point that exec()s `python3 <script>` (see mayhem/launcher.c). The Python deps (atheris, the
# package itself, pytest) are installed into the image system Python by the Dockerfile — they need
# the network and root, which this script (re-run offline as the non-root `mayhem` user at the PATCH
# tier) must NOT require. This script only compiles the shims, so it is idempotent and air-gapped
# (clang, no network).
